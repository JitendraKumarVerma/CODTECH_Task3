This repository contains a project focused on performing customer segmentation analysis on a retail dataset to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behavior. The project involves:

Data Preparation: Load and preprocess the retail dataset.
Feature Engineering: Create relevant features for clustering.
Clustering: Use clustering techniques like K-means or DBSCAN to group customers.
Segment Analysis: Analyze the characteristics of each customer segment.

Features
Data loading and preprocessing
Feature engineering for clustering
Clustering using K-means or DBSCAN
Analysis of customer segments

Visualization
The script includes functions to visualize:
Cluster distributions
Characteristics of each customer segment
These visualizations help in understanding the differences between customer segments.
